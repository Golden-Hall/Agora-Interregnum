Github page for the Agora Interregnum Minecraft Modpack

Welcome to Agora Interregnum

The modpack is an adventure/rpg/city sim pack centred around MineColonies, Immersive Engineering, Create, Ars Nouveau, Blood Magic, Malum and TerraFirmaCraft and several other small and QOL style mods.

Players will progress through a several "Tech Trees" which will unlock machines and buildings for your colony, as well as powerful abilities and advanced technology.


A lot of these features are not currently implemented, but in the current version we've been essentially making sure the mods are accessible (ie, recipe fixes) and began the groundwork for the Tech Tree.

Dev Roadmap
Mod testing 
- Play-through of the mods to identify missing/conflicting recipes.     

- Ensure all ores are spawning

- Ensure mobs are spawning correctly                                           

- This is NOT for re-balance, only making sure that every part of every mod is usable.

Mine-Colonies Rebuilds
- All levels of hut redesigned to accommodate the completely different items that you'll actually have available (Most likely a survival-ish play-through to help with understanding what will actually be available)
- Logical gating behind the progression of the player/s in the colony ( Like needing Bronze to make Shears and stuff)     

- Making sure that each level of the hut matches what 'age' the colony will be in

 

Progression re-balance

- Begin the implementation of the 'tech tree'

- Remove OP recipes that break the game

- Re-balance current recipes to make the pack more cohesive (ie, change input materials to stuff from other mods)

- Ensure full compatibility (eg. adding the ores from TerraFirmaCraft as smeltable objects in the TC smeltery, maybe with a bonus to output)

- Ensure all items that are meant to be outputting pollution for Pollution of the Realms are

- Implement custom Pollutants (eg, Mana, output from Arcane 'machines', turns blocks that it touches into different types, like slime grass for example, and at high enough concentration forces a 'mana storm' or something<?>)

- This will also tie into the mob-spawning, with certain mobs only spawning on certain blocks, which will only be obtainable through the pollution system.

- Custom Mob-Spawning rules

 

Custom Dungeons

- A few different dungeons with custom mob spawns

- More TBA once we know exactly what we want to do here

 

Quests

- A Tech Tree that (using the GameStages mod) will make players complete various objectives in order to gain access to better machines (everyone can get everything in this one)

- A Profession/Class Tree that allow players to specialize in and gain access to more advanced stuff (like OP spells from Ars Nouveau, or the ability to build portals), with cross classing and Profession+Class unlockables (Smith (profession) + Mage (class) = Arcane Smith for example)

 

Lore and RPG 

- Actually writing the lore down somewhere

- Story driven quest-line

- Start building spawn for server
