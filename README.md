# Agora-Interregnum
Github page for the Agora Interregnum Minecraft Modpack

Agora Interregnum is a modpack that completely overhauls the vanilla minecraft experience.

This pack combines my favourite parts of my favourite games, from dungeon delving and magic reminiscent of my favourite RPGs, to resource management and tech trees similar to my favourite factory/colony sim games, and a fun Hex-tech/steam/diesel-punk aesthetic to tie it all together.

Currently implemented features are as follows;
- Custom dungeons
- Custom items (like skill books for mastering the schools of magic ;))
- Tech, profession and magic "tech trees"
- Hundreds of custom recipes (both for new content and for compatibility)
- Full implementation of TerraFirmaCraft (including compat. with almost 200 mods!)
- Pre-installed shaders and Oculus/Rubidium (OptiFine alternative)

We've got a lot in the works, including a fully fledged story, and (soon) a public server so we can all enjoy it together :D
